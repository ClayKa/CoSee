It could return a new search of the papers that cite the previous one (see below).\n\nSince there are 1342 papers, it is not feasible to read all of them (even just abstracts) within short period of time. I made a heuristic for selecting \"interesting\" papers\n\nOnly read the papers that have more than some number of citations (say K).\n\nwhich means I will only have to read papers that in turn have more than K \"cited by\" number.\nEven though this heuristic is unfair for newly published papers, I believe it could indeed help me narrow down my scope.\nHowever, the issue is Google Scholar does not have features to support my heuristic (something like advanced search supported by other databases might). So my problem is\n\nHow do I download the search results from my Google Scholar query with all the meta data, including \"cited by\" information.\nIf the previous point is not possible, is there another tool that could help me?\n\nCould someone help me.
